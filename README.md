  EMAIL_GREETING: 'Hello',
  EMAIL_SIGNATURE: '-- Purchasing Team',

  EMAIL_SENDER: 'auto', // Uses current user's email
  // ... other settings
};
```

1. Go back to your Google Sheet
2. You should see a new **"Order Notifier"** menu
3. Click **Order Notifier** ‚Üí **"Check setup & validate config"**
4. Resolve any issues shown

### Method 2: Test a Single Row

3. Check the **"Automation_Log"** sheet for detailed logs

## üìß How It Works

1. **Trigger Activation**: When you edit the "Order Placed?" column
2. **Value Check**: System checks if the new value means "yes" (accepts: "yes", "y", "true", "1", "placed", "ordered", "complete", etc.)
3. **Validation**: Verifies email address, PO number, and description are present
4. **Duplicate Check**: Ensures this exact order hasn't been emailed recently
5. **Rate Limiting**: Confirms within hourly/daily email limits
6. **Email Generation**: Creates professional HTML and text email
7. **Send & Track**: Sends email and records timestamp in spreadsheet

## üéõÔ∏è Admin Tools

- **Configure sender email**: Change who emails are sent from
- **View current configuration**: See all current settings
- **View email backup log**: See all email attempts (success/failure)
- **View rate limit status**: Check current email sending limits
- **Test email for selected row**: Send test email for debugging
- **Audit data integrity**: Check for data issues in your sheet

## üîß Customization

### Email Template

Modify the `buildEmailContent()` function to customize:
- Email subject line
- HTML formatting
- Email signature
- Additional information included

### Column Recognition

The system automatically recognizes columns with these names (case-insensitive):

- **Email**: "email", "email address", "e-mail"
- **Name**: "name", "full name", "requester name", "user name"
- **PO Number**: "purchase order number", "po number", "po #", "order number"
- **Description**: "purchase order description", "description", "order description"
- **Status**: "order placed?", "order placed", "ordered", "status", "order status"

To add custom column names, modify the `COLUMN_MAPPINGS` in the CONFIG section.

### "Yes" Values

The system recognizes these values as "order placed":
- "yes", "y", "true", "1"
- "placed", "ordered", "complete", "done"
- "confirmed", "approved", "processed"
- And many more...

Add custom values to `YES_VALUES` in the CONFIG section.
